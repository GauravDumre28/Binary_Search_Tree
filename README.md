# Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree implementation using C programming language to Insert node in BST and to Delete a node from BST. Also includes representation of BST using Inorder, Preorder and Postorder Notation. C program includes following options,
    
    1. Insert Node
    2. Delete Node
    3. Print Notation

Project is being organized in folder structure where 'Header_File' has 'header.h', 'Source_Files' has all source files, 'Object_Files' has all object files, 'Executable File' has executable.

The project also includes a Make file to compile and execute the code along with readelf.

Make File options:-
    
    make -> To compile code
    make run -> To execute code
    make clean -> To remove existing object file and executable file
[These are basic operation, for more options check the Make file.]
