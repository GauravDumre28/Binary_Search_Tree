# Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree implementation using C programming language to Insert node in BST and to Delete a node from BST. Dynamic memory allocation is used to create every node and also released the dynamically allocated memory at end of program. Also includes representation of BST using Inorder, Preorder and Postorder Notation. C program includes following options,
    
    1. Insert Node
    2. Delete Node
    3. Search Node
    4. Minimum Value Node
    5. Maximum Value Node
    6. Print Notation (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)

Project is being organized in folder structure where 'Header_File' has 'header.h', 'Source_Files' has all source files, 'Object_Files' has all object files, 'Executable File' has executable.

The project also includes a Make file to compile and execute the code along with readelf.

Make File options:-
    
    make -> To compile code
    make run -> To execute code
    make clean -> To remove existing object file and executable file
[These are basic operation, for more options check the Make file.]
